#Predict-Progression-Outcome-by-Python

Part 1 - Student Version
1. This program allows students to predict their progression outcome at the end of each
academic year.
2. This prompts for the number of credits at pass, defer and fail and then display the
appropriate progression outcome for an individual student.
3. This lets the user know if a credit input is the wrong data type. I.e., ‘Integers
required’ is displayed.
4. This lets the user know if credits are not in the range 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and
120. I.e., ‘Range error’ is displayed.
5. The program should let the user know if the total of the pass, defer and fail credits is not 120.
I.e., ‘Total incorrect’ is displayed.

Part 2 - Staff Version
This extension meets the requirements specified for Part 1 but also allow a staff member to
predict progression outcomes for multiple students.
1. This program prompts for credits at pass, defer and fail and display the appropriate
progression for each individual student until the staff member user enters ‘q’ to quit.
2. When ‘q’ is entered, this produces a ‘histogram’ where each star represents a
student who achieved a progress outcome in the category range: progress, trailing, module
retriever and exclude. See example below.
3. This displays the number of students for each progression category and the total
number of outcomes processed.

Part 3 - Vertical Histogram (optional extension)
Extends the program with an additional histogram that displays vertically so the stars in a category
should go downwards and not across the screen.

Part 4 – Alternative Staff Version (optional extension)
For this staff version the data accesses from a list, tuple or dictionary and NOT from user
input.
